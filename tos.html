        <h3>By purchasing my services (art), you automatically agree to the following conditions.</h3>

        <h2>Rules</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><b>DO NOT</b> claim my work as your own.</li>
            <li><b>DO NOT</b> use commission results to train AI, NFTs, etc. If the commission results are still used for AI, I have the right to request a takedown of the commission results and the client will be placed on <b>BLACKLIST</b></li>
            <li>I have the right to refuse commission requests for any reason.</li>
            <li>I have the right to hold commission work if the client fails to respond to messages/updates regarding the commission for a period exceeding 1.5 months. The commission will be cancelled, and further work will require renegotiation.</li>
            <li><b>First pay = first serve</b></li>
            <li>A 20% deposit is required upfront after submitting the form (the deposit is non-refundable once the rough sketch is completed).</li>
            <li>Full payment is due after the rough sketch is revised.</li>
            <li>If the client does not respond to the invoice I provide within <b>3 x 24</b> hours, I will cancel the commission unilaterally (renegotiation is required if the client wishes to continue payment).</li>
            <li>Cancellation or refund is not possible (unless I cancel the client's commission, in which case the client's money will be fully refunded).</li>
            <li>There will be additional fee for rush commission depending on the deadline requested by the client.</li>
            <li>Payment via local bank BCA, Mandiri, ShopeePay, GoPay, DANA.</li>
            <li>The price listed is for <b>personal use only</b> (social media icons/profiles, headers, wallpapers, etc.).</li>
            <li>The estimated completion time is within 2-3 weeks (may be completed sooner).</li>
            <li><b>Work timeline: agreement > sketch & revision > half-finished & minor revision > finish.</b></li>
            <li>If I am unable to complete the commission within the specified timeframe, the client will be notified.</li>
            <li>If there is a deadline, please communicate it to me.</li>
            <li>It is recommended to inform me of the desired canvas size (e.g., 1:1, 3:4, A4, A5, etc.).</li>
            <li>A maximum of 3 revisions are allowed while the commission is still in sketch (minor revisions are still tolerated in rendering stage). Any revisions beyond that will incur additional fees.</li>
            <li>There will be an additional fee for highly detailed props, clothing, backgrounds, etc. (prices will be adjusted depending on complexity).</li>
            <li>It is recommended to send clear reference photos of the character and character details. It will make the work easier if the client sends additional descriptions of the character.</li>
            <li>It is recommended to send reference photos of the desired pose, background, and expression.</li>
            <li>You may request updates on the commission I am working on if I forget/do not provide updates on the commissioned work (no spam).</li>
            <li>You may post the commission results on social media <b>with credit,</b> to prevent others from stealing the commissioned work and claiming it as their own (I will provide a file with a watermark for posting on social media).</li>
            <li>Commissioned work will be sent via email in PNG and JPG formats.</li>
            <li>I will post commissioned work as part of my portfolio/self-promotion. If the client does'nt want me to post the commissioned work they have ordered, a private fee of 50-100% of the fixed price will be charged.</li>
            <li>If the commission slots are full, clients may contact me to join the waiting list.</li>
        </ul>
