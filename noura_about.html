            <h2>About Noura</h2>
            <p><b>Noura</b> is a passionate artist who has been drawing since 2020 when the Covid-19 pandemic hit. Currently, she's a university student who works as freelance illustrator, and she is also a member of the creative community <b>Kuyangtist</b> from 2023. She enjoys drawing her original characters (OCs), fan art from anime, films, or games she loves, and occasionally explores her own artistic style while studying anatomy, colour theory, and composition according to her mood. <br><br>Aside from drawing, Noura enjoys playing games, her favourites are Love and Deepspace, Reverse: 1999, and Call of Duty: Modern Warfare (though she admits she only watches gameplay walkthroughs). She also occasionally writes short stories about her OCs when feeling inspired, enjoys 100% pure cocoa chocolate, and listens to music a lot. She is a huge fan of Sleep Token, but her playlist can vary from Ariana Grande, Chase Atlantic, The Weeknd, Spiritbox, Cup of Joe, Adikara Fardy, and Kahitna all the way to dangdut — versatility at its finest! She also enjoys makeup and has been into cosplay for the past few years. She also enjoys riding her (father's) motorbike on Sunday mornings — although lately, her university assignments have been keeping her grounded.</p>
